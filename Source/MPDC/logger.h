/**
 * \file logger.h
 * \brief MPDC Logging Functions.
 *
 * \details
 * This header defines the logging functions used throughout the MPDC system. The logger provides
 * a standard mechanism for writing diagnostic and operational messages to a log file. The logging
 * module supports basic operations such as:
 *
 * - Obtaining the default logging file path.
 * - Initializing the logger.
 * - Checking for the existence and retrieving the size of the log file.
 * - Writing plain, decorated, and time-stamped log messages.
 * - Reading the complete log or individual log lines.
 * - Resetting (erasing) and disposing (deleting) the log file.
 *
 * The following macros are defined to specify the maximum message length and the dimensions of the
 * log string storage:
 *   - \ref MPDC_LOGGING_MESSAGE_MAX defines the maximum number of characters for a log message.
 *   - \ref MPDC_LOG_STRING_DEPTH and \ref MPDC_LOG_STRING_SIZE specify the dimensions used for storing
 *     pre-defined log strings.
 *
 * Additionally, static constants provide the default logger path, file name, and header string.
 *
 * These logging routines utilize underlying QSC file and console utilities to ensure thread-safe
 * access to the log file and provide formatted, timestamped output.
