/**

 * \brief The MPDC Root Domain Security server.
 *
 * Detailed File Description:
 * This header file defines the public interface for the MPDC Root Domain Security (RDS)
 * server. The RDS server is responsible for managing the root domain security functions within
 * the MPDC system. This includes handling operations related to the creation, storage, signing,
 * and verification of the root certificate as well as coordinating secure communications with
 * other nodes in the network. The public functions declared here allow the RDS server to be started,
 * paused, and stopped. In addition, when the macro MPDC_DEBUG_TESTS_RUN is defined, a test function
 * is provided to run self-diagnostic tests on the RDS server functionality.
 *
 * Every function declared in this header file is documented with its purpose, parameters, and return
 * value (if any).

 * \brief Pause the RDS server.

 * \brief Stop the RDS server.
