/**

* \brief The MPDC Inter Domain Gateway server
*/

/* Notes: 
* IDG servers exchange root certificates with other networks/domains.
* The IDG certificate has a field that contains an external signature.
* This is the signed hash of the IDG certificate signed by an external certificate authority, 
* which can be an X509 certificate, allowing the domains root certificate to attain an initial
* trust score, while building the MPDC external trust heirarchy.
* Established IDG peers exchange hints about their associations, that can be exchanged to cross populate peer databases, 
* and contribute to the trust value calculation of each node in the database.
* A reursive query sends the hint to external peers, which either answer if the remote IDG certificate is known,
* or query their view of trusted IDG peers in their database. 
* The root (RDS) signature (which signs server certificates within the remote domain), is signed by the IDG,
* and the IDG certificate can be signed by an external X509 certificate authority.
